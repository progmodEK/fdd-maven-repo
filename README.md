## 🔍 Introduction
Beyond basic business logic, domains often incorporate **state-based rules**.<br>
When these state-dependent rules come into the picture, the domain's overall structure
becomes **more complex over time**, making both evolutionary changes and maintenance more difficult

Managing the state complexity often leads us to use **state machines** or **business process management (BPM)** tools.<br>
While valuable, these tools operates as distinct units from the domain, leading to
  - potential inconsistencies
  - integration challenges
  - increased overhead
  - scattered business logic

When using flow-driven-domain, your domain becomes more process-centric:
 - **Flow rules becomes first-call citizen in your your domain**
 - **Flow history is kept inside your domain model**

Please read the [hello world](#hello-world-ex-as-tutorial) as tutorial.
Then try a complete POC application [here](order-preparation-poc/README.md)

## 👋🌍 Hello World ex as tutorial

Let's consider a HELLO WORLD example, where your domain is Greeting Aggregate with a simple Value Object message as String
```java
  public class Greeting {
    private UUIID id;
    private String message;

    public void updateMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public void reset() {
        this.message = "";
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```

Now lets imagine we want to add some process/flow over our Greeting domain to be able to produce "Hello World" greeting message using 2 steps/actions
 - **HELLO**: an Action that set the message to "Hello"
 - **WORLD**: an Action that set the message to "Hello World"

And imagine also we ave these rules:<br>
1- WORLD action cant be executed without a previous HELLO action<br>
2- after HELLO action, if WORLD action is not executed during 30 seconds, the Greeting Domain will reset<br>
3- when WORLD is executed, the Greeting cant be changed anymore (reach a final State)

**Lets explore how we can use the framework to reach our goal.**

### 📦 Step1 - library dependency
Add the library dependency, here is a gradle example:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.progmodek:flow-reactive:1.0.1"  //  "io.github.progmodek:flow:1.0.1"  for non-reactive
}
```

### 🎛️ Step2 - Action, States and flow.json

Define ACTIONS, STATES and a process/flow JSON file based on these ENUMs.

- **ACTION ENUM**

Define a java enum containing the actions your process supports
```java
public enum GreetingAction implements FlowAction {
    HELLO(USER),
    WORLD(USER),
    TIMEOUT(SYSTEM);
    private final ActionType type;    
}
```

> USER vs SYSTEM indicates if its a user action or system action (TIMEOUT is a system action invoked automatically by the system).

- **STATE ENUM**

Define a java enum containing all the states of your process
```java
public enum GreetingState implements FlowState {
    INITIAL,
    PENDING_COMPLETION,
    EXPIRED,
    COMPLETED
}
```
> INITIAL : initial state when we create our Greeting domain<br>
PENDING_COMPLETION : intermediate state(after a HELLO action)<br>
EXPIRED, COMPLETED: final states where no more actions are acceptable

- **FlowType ENUM**

This enum lets you define different flow type (ex DEFAULT), each flow type based on the action and state enum.<br>

```java
public enum GreetinglowType implements FlowType {
    DEFAULT("default-flow.json", GreetingAction.class, GreetingState.class);

    @Getter
    private final String template;
    @Getter
    private final Class<? extends FlowAction> flowActionType;
    @Getter
    private final Class<? extends FlowState> flowStateType;

}
```
> This means that DEFAULT flowType is based on GreetingAction and GreetingState enums, and presented by default-flow.json file.<br>
> you can have for ex another type EXPRESS with another Json file defining another flow.

-  flow **Json file** (default-flow.json in our case)
```json
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "name": "HELLO",
            "delegate": "helloDelegate"
        },
        {
            "name": "WORLD",
            "delegate": "worldDelegate"
        },
        {
            "name": "TIMEOUT",
            "delegate": "timeoutDelegate",
            "expiration": true
        }
    ],
    "states": [
        {
            "name": "INITIAL",
            "initial": true,
            "transitions": [
                {
                    "action": "HELLO",
                    "internal": "PENDING_COMPLETION"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "PENDING_COMPLETION",
            "transitions": [
                {
                    "action": "WORLD",
                    "result": {
                        "success": "COMPLETED"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "action": "TIMEOUT",
                    "result": {
                        "success": "EXPIRED"
                    },
                    "timer": {
                        "sec": 30
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "EXPIRED",
            "transitions": []
        },
        {
            "name": "COMPLETED",
            "transitions": []
        }
    ]
} 
```
> Explanations:<br>
--We list the ACTIONS with their associated delegates (these delegates will be invoked when the action is invoked)<br>
--**TIMEOUT** action have also "expiration=true", this tells that this action is used for expiration and the system will be able to compute "expiresAt" automatically based on the state you currently are.<br>
--**INITIAL** state has "initial=true", means when we create our Greeting Aggregate it will be in an **INITIAL** state.<br>
--**INITIAL** state have only 1 transition with the action **HELL**O and transit to **PENDING_COMPLETION** state.<br>
--**PENDING_COMPLETION** has 2 transitions, one with action **WORLD** that transit to **COMPLETED** state, and one with **TIMEOUT** (this one is automatic with a **timer** of 30sec),
means that while in **PENDING_COMPLETION** state, if no **WORLD** action is called, it will automatically transit to **EXPIRED** after 30 sec

### ⚙️ Step3 - Implement Flowable interface

Let your Domain Aggregate Implement the Flowable Interface
```java
public interface Flowable<ID> {
  ID getId();
  String getState();
  void setState(String state);
  Flow getFlow();
  void setFlow(Flow flow);
}
```
> The Flowable interface requires the implementation of getters and setters for ID, State, and Flow properties, which are essential for a process-centric model.

So the greeting becomes:
```java
@Data
public class Greeting implements Flowable<UUID> {
    // your aggregate ID
    private UUID id;
    private String message;
    
    // -----------------------------------------------------  
    // flow elements to add to your domain
    // remember that your domain becomes process-centric, 
    // means it holds the flow history
    private String state;
    private Flow flow;
    // -----------------------------------------------------

    public void updateMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```
> **NB**: you have to persist these property in your repository<br>
  if you are using NOSQL it will be straight forward,<br>
  if not you must persist Flow property as json or jsonb

### ✍️ Step4 - Implement delegates defined in flow.json

Define an ActionDelegate for each **Action**.<br>
these delegate encapsulate the necessary business logic for the corresponding action.
```java
@Component
public class HelloDelegate implements ActionDelegate<Greeting, DelegateParams, Greeting> {

    @Override
    public Mono<UserStory> execute(final Greeting greeting, final Map<String, Object> variables, final DelegateParams delegateParams) {
        // implement process related logic, ex call a API, etc..
        // and invoke(or not) a behavior on our aggregate
        greeting.updateMessage("Hello");
        return Mono.just(greeting);
    }

}

@Component
public class WorldDelegate implements ActionDelegate<Greeting, DelegateParams, Greeting> {

    @Override
    public Greeting execute(final Greeting greeting, final Map<String, Object> variables, final DelegateParams delegateParams) {
        // implement process related logic, ex call a API, etc.. (in our case nothing special)
        // and invoke(or not) a behavior on our aggregate (in our case we update the message)
        greeting.updateMessage("Hello World");
        return greeting;
    }

}

@Component
public class TimeoutDelegate extends SystemActionDelegate<Greeting> {

    @Override
    public Greeting execute(final Greeting greeting, final Map<String, Object> variables) {
        // implement process related logic, ex call a API, etc.. (in our case nothing special)
        // and invoke(or not) a behavior on our aggregate (in our case we reset the aggregate after a timeout)
        greeting.reset();
        return greeting;
    }

}
```
> Each delegate must implement the generic **ActionDelegate<T extends Flowable, I, R>**<br>
-**T** type is your aggregate<br>
-**I** type is the input that you can pass to the delegate (a request object containing params)<br>
-**R** type is the return type (in our ex its the aggregate itself, but you can return a response from calling an external api for ex)<br>

> **Note**: for the system action **TIMEOUT" we extends **SystemActionDelegate<T extends Flowable>** which is a special implementation of ActionDelegate without input params and the aggregate as return value


### 🗄️ Step5 - Your domain Repository and your DataBase

####  Implements the FlowRepository interface
Let your **DomainRepository**  extends this **FlowRepository** interface<br>

```java
public interface FlowRepository<T extends Flowable, ID> {
  Optional<T> findById(ID flowId);
  T save(T flowable);
}
```
> This interface contains only the already used method in Spring Repositories so it should be straight froward.<br>
Means if you are using Spring Data or Spring JPA these methods are already handled

ex for reactive mode :
```java
public interface DomainRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Greeting, UUID>, FlowRepository<Greeting, UUID> {
}
```
or JPA mode
```java
public interface DomainRepository extends JpaRepository<Greeting, UUID>, FlowRepository<Greeting, UUID> {
}
```

> the framework includes a Base FlowRepository implementation in case you are using postgres jsonb
> so you can use it to define your domain repository as follow:
```java
@Bean
public FlowRepository<Greeting, UUID> greetingPostGresRepository() {
        return new BaseR2dbcPostgresJsonRepository<>(Greeting.class)
        .setTableInfo(table_name, jsonb_column);
        }
```

#### Create Your Domain DB table

> the **Flow** property should always be in JSON format
> Best Practice: use JSONB if you are using postgres

Following are some example using postgres JSONB<br>
If you are using JSONB for all your aggregate, your table would be
```roomsql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS greeting (
  id uuid NOT NULL,
  greeting_data jsonb NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT flow_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

If you are using JSONB only for the **Flow** property of your aggregate, your table would be
```roomsql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS greeting (
  id uuid NOT NULL,
  message varchar NOT NULL,
  flow_data jsonb NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT flow_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

> you can off course use a DB other than postgresql

#### Create the Tasks Table
create a table where scheduled tasks will be saved (flow capabilities like timeouts or other scheduled automatic tasks)
ex for postgres
```roomsql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flow_task (
    id varchar NOT NULL,
    score int8 NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ver INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
> Replace the types by your specific database types (ex VARCHAR(255), BIGINT, INTEGER)

### 🚀 Step6 - Create the FlowEngine

The FlowEngine is pivotal in managing the lifecycle of flowable domain objects, interfacing with the repository to maintain state consistency and handle transitions.<br>
In a DDD point of vue it is the application layer (check [framework design](#framework-ddd-design)).

Instantiate a FlowEngine with the:<br>
-**ID class type** of your Aggregate<br>
-**Aggragte  class type**<br>
-**Repository** of your domain

```java
@Bean
FlowEngine<Greeting, UUID> flowEngine(DomainRepository repo) {
    return new FlowEngine<>(UUID.class, Greeting.class, repo);
}
```

### 🔄 Step7 - Make your domain flowable
Make your domain flowable and execute actions on your domain

####  Make your Domain Flowabe
```java
Greeting greeting = 'create your Aggragte'
flowEngine.makeFlowable(greeting, ProductflowType.DEFAULT, Map.of());
```
> we can pass a MAP that will be saved to the variables property of the Flow if we want for later use
####  Invoke Actions
```java
flowEngine.applyAction(id, HELLO, inputParams) 
```
and here you go, your domain will be process-centric (check the state and the flow properties)
```json
{
    "id": "e30d2da8-f18e-4c43-bd84-bcffb726cb37",
    "message" : "Hello",
    "flow": {
        "flowType": "DEFAULT",
        "eligibleActions": ["WORLD"],
        "actions": [
            {
                "name": "HELLO",
                "type": "USER",
                "count": 1,
                "executions": [
                    {
                    "executedAt": "2023-08-23T15:48:11.091511Z",
                    "result": "success",
                    "previousState": "INITIAL",
                    "nextState": "PENDING_COMPLETE"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    "state": "PENDING_COMPLETE"
}
```
> we can see when the **HELLO** action was executed and how the state arrived to **PENDING_COMPLETE** and we see too that the Greeting will expire in 30sec with the **expiresAt** property

### 📣 Step8 - Listen and publish flow events

Each executed **Action** is considered as a **flow Event**.<br>
All flow events are pushed to **EventsPublishers**, implementing custom event publishers allows you to have an event-driven architecture.<br>
You can define your own Event Publisher:<br>

```java
@Component
@Slf4j
public class KafkaEventPublisher implements EventsPublisher {
  @Override
  public void publishEvents(final Flowable aggregate) {
    log.info("PUBLISH EVENTS TO KAFKA IF YOU WANT");
  }
}
```

> The framework includes an ActionLogger as an EventsPublisher which logs all the executedAction.<br>
> You can define your own Logger as EventsPublisher and disable the framework one


## 🏗️ Framework DDD Design

The framework design follows DDD principles.<br>
- Your Aggregate (your principal entity), is at the heart of the domain
- The Framework flowEngine acts as the Application layer of your domain
- The flow related mechanism (actions eligibility, transitions, etc..) is coded as a Domain Service<br>

## 🛠️ Flow Functionalities

We saw in HelloWorld example some features of the **flow.json** when defining actions, states and transitions.<br>
Here is a List of most of the features and how to use them

### action

we can use these properties on each **action** defined in the **JSON** file
 - **delegate**: the spring bean (implementation of an ActionDelegate) that will be invoked 
 - **expiration**: ture/false(default) used to compute an **expiredAt** functionality (inside the **flow** property of the aggregate) 

```json
{
  "name": "TIMEOUT",
  "delegate": "timeoutDelegate",
  "expiration": true
}
```

> When defined as "expiration" action, whenever we are in a state including a transition with a TIMEOUT action, an "expiresAt" property will be computed,
> and users knows explicitly when the process will expire.

### state

we can use these properties on each **state** defined in the **JSON** file
- **initial**: ture/false(default) to indicate that it will be the INITIAL state of the aggregate<br>
Remember how we make the aggregate flowable
```java
Greeting greeting = 'create your Aggragte'
flowEngine.makeFlowable(greeting, ProductflowType.DEFAULT, Map.of());
```

```json
{
  "name": "INITIAL",
  "initial": true,
}
```

### transition

we can use these properties on each **transition** defined in the **JSON** file
- **internal**: indicates that the transition is internal, means the state will remains the same
- **dependsOn**: indicates that the transition depends on a preceding action. normally used with **internal** transitions
              ex: if we have 3 internal transition with A1,A2 and A3, we can say that the 2nd transition using A2  dependsOn A1
- **result**: this String based map indicates where to transit based on functional results (success, waiting, error, etc..)
- **timer**: indicates that the action will be automatically executed after x sec
- **exceptions**: indicates where to transit based on exceptions (exceptions can be launched from action delegates using the **DelegateException**)
- **retry**: number of retries (in case of exceptions) before transiting to another state

```json
"transitions": [
  {
    "action": "APPROVE",
    "result": {
      "success": "APPROVED",
      "error": "NOT_APPROVED"
    },
    "exceptions": {
      "001": "PENDING_APPROVAL"
    },
    "retry": {
      "number": 3,
      "exceeded": "NOT_APPROVED"
    },
    "timer": {
      "sec": 30
    }
  }
]
```

> **APPROVE** action will be launched in **30sec** (**timer**)<br>
> if the **functional** result (fom the actionDelegate) is **success** then transit to **APPROVED**<br>
> If the **functional** result (fom the actionDelegate) is **error** then transit to **NOT_APPROVED**<br>
> if an **exception** is thrown (**technical** exception from the delegate) then transit to **PENDING_APPROVAL**<br>
> in case of other *$exceptions** (not handled by the exceptions part) occurred then stay in same state, but after **3 retries**  transit to **NOT_APPROVED**<br>


## ✅ Advantages

- **Consistency and audability**: 
  - Enables easy tracking and auditing of all state changes
  - With state and transition history within the domain, there’s no loss of data or inconsistencies
- **Unit testing**:
  - test youre aggregate behavior independently of process behaviour
  - test your process rules by testing each sepearate delegate
- **Usefull process-centric properties**:
  - **expiresAT**: let users know when and if the process will expire
  - **eligibleActions**: gives the user to know wihc possible actions are allowed (depending on the state)
- **Easy to use and fun to integrate**:
  - Intuitive design base on Enums and JSON workflow descriptors
  - Seamless integration with only some few components to configure
- **Cost & time effective**:
  - Reduces the overhead of managing separate BPM tools


## 💼 Use Cases

Here is a list of some use cases that can be thought as a flow driven domain:

- **Checkout Process**  (process-centric model of an order being placed)
  - Domain Aggregate: Checkout implements Flowable {}
  - Domain Entities: Items, shippings ,payments
  - Flow states: PENDING_SHIPPING,  PENDING_PAYMENT,  COMPLETED, EXPIRED, etc..


- **Order Preparation** (check the full application [here](#poc-order-preparation))
  - Domain Aggregate: OrderPreparation implements Flowable {}
  - Domain Entities: Items
  - Flow states: TO_PREPARE, IN_PREPARATION, PENDING_PICKUP, DELIVERED, COMPLETED, etc.


- **Product Lifecycle**  (representing the process/lifecycle of a product design and development)
  - Domain Aggregate: ProductDesign implements Flowable {}  
  - Domain Entities: InitialDesign, Prototype, FeedBack, etc..
  - Flow states: PENDING_PROTOTYPING, PENDING_TEST, PRODUCED, STOPPED, etc.


- **Job Application Process**
  - Domain Aggregate: JobApplication implements Flowable {}   (representing the entire lifecycle of the job application)
  - Domain Entities: ApplicantProfile, JobPosition, Evaluation, etc..
  - Flow states: PENDING_REVIEW, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, etc.


- **And much more…** (every domain can have its own process-centric view)

## 📝 Order Preparation POC

A complete POC application for Preparation of Orders in a click-and-collect retail environment can be found [here](order-preparation-poc/README.md)
> Prerequisite: **JAVA 17** or higher

## 🔧 Flow configuration

here are some properties to configure in **application.yaml**
> Default values are already configured, use only if you want to override

```yaml
flow:
  actionLogger:
    enabled: true    // Default Logger component enabled by default
  taskConsumer:
    scheduleMilli: 1000   // schedule for pooling for async tasks (the system tasks that should be executed automatically)
```

## 🌟 Genesis and Achievement: Decathlon success story

The foundational **concept of the Framework** was originally crafted for **Decathlon**.<br>
It was specifically tailored to address their **checkout process** needs and challenges.<br>

This concept, a testament to our innovative approach, has been successfully implemented within Decathlon, demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability in a real-world, enterprise environment.<br>

Building on this initial success, the concept was further evolved into a full-fledged framework,
guided by principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.
