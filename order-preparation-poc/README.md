# Order Preparation POC

Here is a complete example of an Order Preparation domain.
> The same application exist in reactive mode (spring webflux and project reactor) under
> **order-preparation-poc-reactive**

> Prerequisite: **JAVA 17** or higher

## Use Case Explanation

Our application is designed to manage the preparation of orders in a click-and-collect retail environment.<br>
When a customer places an order online and chooses the click-and-collect option, the orderPreparation must be created in our system in a 'TO_PREPARE' state. 
The goal is to efficiently move the order through various steps until it's ready for the customer to pick up.<br>
The following states and actions define this journey:

- States:
    - TO_PREPARE: initial state
    - IN_PREPARATION: The order is actively being prepared, items are being picked
    - PENDING_PICKUP: Preparation is complete, and the order is waiting for the customer to collect it
    - DELIVERED: The customer has picked up the order, completing the process
- Actions:
    - START_PREPARATION  : start the preparation,transitioning to IN_PREPARATION state
    - PICK_ITEMS         : Select items for the order. This can occur multiple times. Once all items are picked, the order moves to 'PENDING_PICKUP'.
    - PICKUP             : The customer collects their order, transitioning it to the 'DELIVERED' state.
    - NOTIFY_OM (notify Order Manager): Automatically triggered when the order reaches the 'DELIVERED' state, informing the Order Manager that the order has been picked up.

### Process rules:
- Sequential Flow: The order must follow the sequence of 'START_PREPARATION' → 'PICK_ITEMS' → 'PICKUP'.
- Multiple Item Picking: 'PICK_ITEMS' can be executed several times as needed. Only when all items are ready does the order shift to 'PENDING_PICKUP'.
- Automatic Notification: Upon reaching 'DELIVERED', an automatic notification is sent to the Order Manager.
- Error Handling: In case of notification failure, the order enters 'RETRY_NOTIFICATION', where it attempts to notify the Order Manager again every 10 seconds, up to 3 retries. Success moves the order to a 'COMPLETE' state, while failure leads to an 'ERROR' state.

> check the **[in-store-workflow.json](src/main/resources/flow/in-store-workflow.json)** to understand how all these rules are configured

### Aggregate rules:

- Item Existence Check: The system checks that the items being picked are part of the original order.
- Quantity Verification: The quantity of each item picked cannot exceed the quantity specified in the order.

> check  **[OrderPreparation.java](src/main/java/com/progmod/poc/domain/OrderPreparation.java)** and **[Item.java](src/main/java/com/progmod/poc/domain/Item.java)**  to understand how these business invariants are coded

## Note on Repository:

The poc repository uses a built-in framework helper for using a postgres jsonb, where all the aggregate is saved in one 'data' column.<br>
check **[PocConfig.java](src/main/java/com/progmod/poc/PocConfig.java)** where we define the repository using the framework helper class
```java
@Bean
public FlowRepository<OrderPreparation, UUID> orderPostgresRepository() {
  return new BasePostgresJsonRepository<>(OrderPreparation.class)
        .setTableInfo("order_preparation", "data");
}
```
> It is up to you to define your aggregate repository, the only prerequisite is to implements the **FlowRepository**

## DataBase tables

we create 2 tables for this POC
- The Aggregate Table
```roomsql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS poc.order_preparation (
	id uuid NOT NULL,
	data jsonb NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT order_preparation_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

- Task Table used by the framework to handle async system tasks

```roomsql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS poc.flow_task (
	id varchar NOT NULL,
	score int8 NOT NULL,
	status varchar NOT NULL,
	ver int4 NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT flow_task_pk PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Install and launch

- **clone the repo**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/progmodEK/flow-driven-domain.git
```

- **launch a postgres container**
```shell
cd flow-driven-domain
mkdir -p ./tools/data/postgres-data
docker-compose up &
```

- **launch the application**
```shell
./gradlew :order-preparation-poc:bootRun
```
> replace with **order-preparation-poc-reactive** for the reactive app


##  APIs collection

After starting the application, you can interact with the API running on port 8081.<br>

### Postman collection
> if you are using Postman, import this collection **./tools/POC.postman_collection**<br>
> and just use it

### Curl commands
> Replace 'ID' in the URL with the actual aggregate ID obtained after creating an order.

- create an order to prepare 
```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8081/pocs' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
   "orderRef" : "orderXYZ",
   "items": [
        {
            "skuId": "123",
            "name": "sku123",
            "qty": 2
        },
        {
            "skuId": "456",
            "name": "sku456",
            "qty": 3
        }
   ]
}'
```

- start the preparation
```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8081/pocs/ID/start-preparation'
```

- pick items
```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8081/pocs/ID/pick-items' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "pickItems" : [
        {
            "skuId" : "123",
            "qty": 2
        },
         {
            "skuId" : "456",
            "qty": 3
        }

    ]
}'
```

- pickup the order
```shell
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8081/pocs/ID/pickup'
```

- view the Aggregate
```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8081/pocs/ID'
```

> Testing Scenarios:
>- Ensure you cant "pick items" before "start preparation" 
>- Verify you cant pick items more than the order's quantity
>- Verify that you can call multiple times "pick items" (all the api with less quantities and you will stay in the state IN_PREPARATION
>- check that after PICKUP invoked, there we will an async action invoked by the system to notify the Order manager (view the aggregate to check how it evolves)
